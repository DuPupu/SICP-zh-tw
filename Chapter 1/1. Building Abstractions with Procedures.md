以程序建立抽象
===================

> 人的心智活動透過簡單的概念而發揮它的力量，方法主要可分為三種:
> 第一，把數個簡單的概念組合成一個複合的概念，於是所有複雜的概念成焉。
> 第二，將兩個概念，不論簡單或複雜，不將它們結合，而是同時並列在一起觀察，如此就能得知何為相互關聯。
> 第三，把某些概念，與伴隨它們其他真實存在的概念區隔出來，這稱為**抽象化**，所有一般化、概化的概念皆是由此而生。

 We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

我們打算要學習何為**計算程序 (computational process)**。 計算程序是住在計算機裡的抽象存在。計算程序的發展過程中操縱著另一種稱作數據的抽象物體。而程序自身的發展則是受到一種叫做**程式**的規則模式所控制。人們創造程式來控制程序。實際上，我們好似在用我們的魔法咒語控制著計算機的靈魂。

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

計算程序確實像極了魔法師一類的事，它既看不見也摸不著，也不是以物質組成的。然而，它的卻非常真實，它能做需要智力的工作
，回答問題，在銀行裡支付金錢，或者在工廠裡控制機械手臂，藉此影響世界。而我們用以驅使計算程序的的程式，就像是魔法師的咒語一樣。我們用神秘又深奧的程式語言，小心地組成一些符號語句，以此規範我們要計算程序執行的工作。

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.

在運轉中的計算機裡，計算程序總是分毫不差，精準地執行程式工作。因此，就像見習魔法師一樣，菜鳥程式員必須學著去了解，並且預期使用魔法咒語的結果。即使僅僅是程式裡的小錯誤 (通常稱為臭蟲或故障)，也會造成複雜而無法預料的結果。

Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.

幸好學習寫程式比學魔法咒語安全多了，我們處裡的鬼靈們安全又冷靜。然而，真實世界裡的程式設計依舊需要細心，專門知識和智慧。舉例來說，一個在計算機輔助設計系統裡的小小 Bug ，可能導致飛機或水壩災難性的損毀，或者工業機器人自爆。

Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended. They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.
